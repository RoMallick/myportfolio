Undergraduate Research Assistant at Purdue University

## Projects and Lab Contributions
1. Working closely with doctoral student, Pallavi Mishra, we devised a way to study subjects and apply their cognitive skills in a deep learning computational model of the 3D reconstruction of vision. I personally wrote the experiment in Python and accumulated data that Pallavi used to teach her deep learning model.
2. Project lead on a reinforcment learning approach in solving the traveling salesman problem with Dr. Sébastien Hélie as my acting advisor.
3. As part of my duties, I regularly proctor and administer NSF/IRB approved psychological studies for other graduate students in the lab.
