## Human Research and Engineering Directorate (HRED) - Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD

## Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education (ORISE)
Journeyman fellow  :  07.2019 - 09.2019
1. Under the mentorship of Dr. Nicholas Waytowich, I created a 3D simulation of drones as a platform to demonstrate proof of concept ideas to minimize potential damage to real world drones.
2. As a team, we addressed the issue of autonomous landing on a moving target. My main contribution included creating april tags and testing their efficacy in detection and acquisition of the autonomous agent. I also started to implement an imitation learning algorithm that would be used concurrently with other reinforcement learning tactics by the group.

## Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education (ORISE)
Summer Journeyman Fellow  :  05.2018 - 08.2018
1. Under Dr. Nicholas Waytowich we investigated human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning in regards to ground robots. Based on previous words of Dr. Waytowich and colleagues in reinforcement learning and atari bowling, I was able to apply his novel algorithm in an entirely new context of a physical ground robot.
2. Also assisted others in the group in creating an imitation learning approach to promote the robot learning to execute certain processes.
3. Established a multi-purposed testing environment for the ground robot. 

## College Qualified Leaders (CQL)
Summer Student  :  05.2017 - 08.2017
1. Under the mentorship of Dr. Anthony Ries we questioned whether reaction time varies based on fixation onset asynchrony.
2. To test this, I created a psychopy experiment in python in conjunction with a Tobii eye tracker to compile eye metics with reaction time. Varying 

## Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education (ORISE)
Summer Journeyman fellow  :  05.2016 - 08.2016
1. Under the mentorship of Dr. Anthony Ries, Dr. Jon Touryan, and Dr. Brent Lance I was able to publish a paper on the use of eye metrics to index cognitive workload in video games.
2. This summer was used to complete statistical analyses of the previous summer's data. These analyses included but are not limited to one-way ANOVA, standard error, t-tests, and more through Matlab.

## Science and Engineering Apprenticeship Program (SEAP)
Summer Student  :  06.2015 - 08.2015
1. Under the mentorship of Dr. Anthony Ries, Dr. Jon Touryan, and Dr. Brent Lance, I researched the relationship between eye metrics and cognitive workload.
2. This project was a subset from an overarching exploration of the relationship between eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) for improvising visual search and user interfaces.
3. I was personally responsible in structuring the code that processed the large amount of data and compiling it into a comprehensible format.

## Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) - Adelphi, MD

## Science and Engineering Apprenticeship Program (SEAP)
Summer Student  : 06.2014 - 08.2014
1. Under the mentorship of Dr. William Nothwang, I joined a group focusing on developing an autonomous micro-quadcopter capable of surveillance and reconnaissance through SLAM mapping and more.
2. Contributing to the group, I was tasked with testing various wifi modules to determine how frequency is related to radio propagation in various environments. The aim being that the quadcopter continue on doing what it is doing in various environments such as the forest, or building and continue to transmit data.
